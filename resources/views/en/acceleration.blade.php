    <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify">In Posterum’s acceleration program brings together the resources of the In Posterum Foundation and its strategic relationships and provides participating emerging businesses with hands on expertise from an experienced team, potential seed capital and an opportunity to share experiences with other entrepreneurs.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify">The In Posterum Business Accelerator is operated as a tailored acceleration program, providing the benefits and assets of a business accelerator experience to companies that are created by entrepreneurs that do not want to participate in a more group-driven accelerator. Our acceleration approach does not have an end-point or a defined period – there is no “deal day” – our acceleration companies become part of the In Posterum family of companies, and we work with them for extended periods of growth and development.</p>
